#What is Bank Churn?
Bank customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a bank or switch to another bank. Churn is a critical metric for banks as it directly impacts their customer base and revenue. Customer churn can occur due to various reasons, such as dissatisfaction with services, better offers from competitors, changes in financial needs, or poor customer experiences.![POWER_BI_PRO_3](https://github.com/nitish4393/BANK_CUSTOMER_CHURN_ANALYSIS_USING_SQL/assets/120879393/e70d7dc1-5cba-48c2-a393-c29e9685c527)
